# Getting Started with the movie watchlist react app
##Description

This is front-end practice project which integrated [TMDB Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2) to build a movie watchlist web app.\
Users can search movies on the `+ ADD` page and add them to the `watchlist`.\
The movies will be saved into the watchlist that stores at the `localStorage` on users' browser.\
The movies can be moved between the `watchlist` and the `watched` and can be deleted from the lists.

## Run the project
Create new `.env` file under the project root directory and modify the following lines to your own keys.
```angular2html
REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY = ***YOUR API KEY***
REACT_APP_FONT_AWESOME_API_KEY = ***YOUR API KEY***
```
\
In the project directory, you can run:\
`npm start`

The script runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
